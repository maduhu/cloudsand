"Event notification framework provides a means for the Management Server "
"components to publish and subscribe to &PRODUCT; events. Event notification "
"is achieved by implementing the concept of event bus abstraction in the "
"Management Server. An event bus is introduced in the Management Server that "
"allows the &PRODUCT;components and extension plug-ins to subscribe to the "
"events by using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) client. In "
"&PRODUCT;, a default implementation of event bus is provided as a plug-in "
"that uses the RabbitMQ AMQP client. The AMQP client pushes the published "
"events to a compatible AMQP server. Therefore all the &PRODUCT; events are "
"published to an exchange in the AMQP server."

"A new event for state change, resource state change, is introduced as part "
"of Event notification framework. Every resource, such as user VM, volume, "
"NIC, network, public IP, snapshot, and template, is associated with a state "
"machine and generates events as part of the state change. That implies that "
"a change in the state of a resource results in a state change event, and the"
" event is published in the corresponding state machine on the event bus. All"
" the &PRODUCT; events (alerts, action events, usage events) and the "
"additional category of resource state change events, are published on to the"
" events bus."
