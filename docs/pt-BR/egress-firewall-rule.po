"The egress traffic originates from a private network to a public network, "
"such as the Internet. By default, the egress traffic is blocked, so no "
"outgoing traffic is allowed from a guest network to the Internet. However, "
"you can control the egress traffic in an Advanced zone by creating egress "
"firewall rules. When an egress firewall rule is applied, the traffic "
"specific to the rule is allowed and the remaining traffic is blocked. When "
"all the firewall rules are removed the default policy, Block, is applied."
