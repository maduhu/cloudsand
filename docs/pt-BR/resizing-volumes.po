"&PRODUCT; provides the ability to resize data disks; &PRODUCT; controls "
"volume size by using disk offerings. This provides &PRODUCT; administrators "
"with the flexibility to choose how much space they want to make available to"
" the end users. Volumes within the disk offerings with the same storage tag "
"can be resized. For example, if you only want to offer 10, 50, and 100 GB "
"offerings, the allowed resize should stay within those limits. That implies "
"if you define a 10 GB, a 50 GB and a 100 GB disk offerings, a user can "
"upgrade from 10 GB to 50 GB, or 50 GB to 100 GB. If you create a custom-"
"sized disk offering, then you have the option to resize the volume by "
"specifying a new, larger size."

"Additionally, using the resizeVolume API, a data volume can be moved from a "
"static disk offering to a custom disk offering with the size specified. This"
" functionality allows those who might be billing by certain volume sizes or "
"disk offerings to stick to that model, while providing the flexibility to "
"migrate to whatever custom size necessary."
