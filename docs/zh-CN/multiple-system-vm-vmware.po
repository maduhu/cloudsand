"Every &PRODUCT; zone has single System VM for template processing tasks such"
" as downloading templates, uploading templates, and uploading ISOs. In a "
"zone where VMware is being used, additional System VMs can be launched to "
"process VMware-specific tasks such as taking snapshots and creating private "
"templates. The &PRODUCT; management server launches additional System VMs "
"for VMware-specific tasks as the load increases. The management server "
"monitors and weights all commands sent to these System VMs and performs "
"dynamic load balancing and scaling-up of more System VMs."
msgstr "每个&PRODUCT; 资源域都有单独的系统虚拟机用于处理关于模版的各种任务，如下载模版，上传模版，上传ISO。在使用VMware的资源域中，会启动额外的系统虚拟机用于执行VMware的特殊任务，如做快照和创建私有模版。当VMware特殊任务压力增加时，&PRODUCT; 管理服务器会启动额外的系统虚拟机。管理服务器会监控并权衡所有发往这些系统虚拟机的命令，并执行动态负载均衡和扩展更多的系统虚拟机。"
