"A zone is the second largest organizational unit within a &PRODUCT; "
"deployment. A zone typically corresponds to a single datacenter, although it"
" is permissible to have multiple zones in a datacenter. The benefit of "
"organizing infrastructure into zones is to provide physical isolation and "
"redundancy. For example, each zone can have its own power supply and network"
" uplink, and the zones can be widely separated geographically (though this "
"is not required)."
