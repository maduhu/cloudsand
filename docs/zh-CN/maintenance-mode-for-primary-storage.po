"Primary storage may be placed into maintenance mode. This is useful, for "
"example, to replace faulty RAM in a storage device. Maintenance mode for a "
"storage device will first stop any new guests from being provisioned on the "
"storage device. Then it will stop all guests that have any volume on that "
"storage device. When all such guests are stopped the storage device is in "
"maintenance mode and may be shut down. When the storage device is online "
"again you may cancel maintenance mode for the device. The &PRODUCT; will "
"bring the device back online and attempt to start all guests that were "
"running at the time of the entry into maintenance mode."
msgstr "主存储可以被设置成维护模式。这是有用的，例如，替换在存储设备中坏的RAM。对存储设备的维护模式将首先停止任何新的来自预处理的来宾，然后停止所有有数据卷的来宾。当所有来宾被停止的时候，这个存储设备就进入维护模式了并且可以关机。当存储设备再一次在线的时候，你可以取消维护模式对这个设备。&PRODUCT;将返回在线状态并且试着启动所有曾在这个设备进入维护模式前运行的来宾机器。"
