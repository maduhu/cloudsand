"&PRODUCT; account owners can create virtual private networks (VPN) to access"
" their virtual machines. If the guest network is instantiated from a network"
" offering that offers the Remote Access VPN service, the virtual router "
"(based on the System VM) is used to provide the service. &PRODUCT; provides "
"a L2TP-over-IPsec-based remote access VPN service to guest virtual networks."
" Since each network gets its own virtual router, VPNs are not shared across "
"the networks. VPN clients native to Windows, Mac OS X and iOS can be used to"
" connect to the guest networks. The account owner can create and manage "
"users for their VPN. &PRODUCT; does not use its account database for this "
"purpose but uses a separate table. The VPN user database is shared across "
"all the VPNs created by the account owner. All VPN users get access to all "
"VPNs created by the account owner."
msgstr "&PRODUCT; account拥有者可以建立 VPN 以便访问他们的虚拟机。如果来宾网络 从一个提供 远程VPN访问服务的网络实例化，虚拟路由(在 System VM上的)将被用于提供服务。\n&PRODUCT; 提供了一个 基于 L2TP-over-IPsec-based 协议的远程VPN访问服务 给 guest虚拟网络。 因为每个网络有它自己的 虚拟路由， VPNs 没有在这些网络中被共享。Windows, Mac OS X和iOS的原生(自带) VPN客户端 可以用于访问 来宾网络。account拥有者可以建立并管理他们的VPN用户。&PRODUCT; 不使用自己账户数据库，而是用了另外一个独立的表。VPN用户数据库在同一个account拥有者建立的VPN网络中被共享。 也就是说，同一个account拥有者建立里的全部VPN可以被它的全部VPN用户访问。"
