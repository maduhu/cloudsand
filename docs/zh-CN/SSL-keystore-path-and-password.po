"If the LDAP server requires SSL, you need to enable it in the ldapConfig "
"command by setting the parameters ssl, truststore, and truststorepass. "
"Before enabling SSL for ldapConfig, you need to get the certificate which "
"the LDAP server is using and add it to a trusted keystore. You will need to "
"know the path to the keystore and the password."
msgstr "如果LDAP 服务器要求SSL， 你需要在ldapConfig命令中通过设置参数ssl, truststore和truststorepass使其生效。在使SSL 对ldapConfig 生效之前，你需要得到LDAP服务器在使用的证书并把它加到被信任的键存储中。你将需要知道到键存储和密码的路径。"
