"If you create load balancing rules while using a network service offering "
"that includes an external load balancer device such as NetScaler, and later "
"change the network service offering to one that uses the &PRODUCT; virtual "
"router, you must create a firewall rule on the virtual router for each of "
"your existing load balancing rules so that they continue to function."
msgstr "如果你创建的负载均衡规则同时使用的网络提供方案使用到了外部的负载均衡器设备（比如NetScaler）,随后又改变为使用虚拟路由器的网络提供方案,你必须在虚拟路由器上为每个已存在的负载聚恒规则创建一个防火墙规则以使它们继续生效。"
