"Traffic Sentinel is a network traffic usage data collection package. "
"&PRODUCT; can feed statistics from Traffic Sentinel into its own usage "
"records, providing a basis for billing users of cloud infrastructure. "
"Traffic Sentinel uses the traffic monitoring protocol sFlow. Routers and "
"switches generate sFlow records and provide them for collection by Traffic "
"Sentinel, then &PRODUCT; queries the Traffic Sentinel database to obtain "
"this information"

"To construct the query, &PRODUCT; determines what guest IPs were in use "
"during the current query interval. This includes both newly assigned IPs and"
" IPs that were assigned in a previous time period and continued to be in "
"use. &PRODUCT; queries Traffic Sentinel for network statistics that apply to"
" these IPs during the time period they remained allocated in &PRODUCT;. The "
"returned data is correlated with the customer account that owned each IP and"
" the timestamps when IPs were assigned and released in order to create "
"billable metering records in &PRODUCT;. When the Usage Server runs, it "
"collects this data."
