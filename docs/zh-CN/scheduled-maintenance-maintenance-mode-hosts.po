"You can place a host into maintenance mode. When maintenance mode is "
"activated, the host becomes unavailable to receive new guest VMs, and the "
"guest VMs already running on the host are seamlessly migrated to another "
"host not in maintenance mode. This migration uses live migration technology "
"and does not interrupt the execution of the guest."
msgstr "您可以将主机置于维护模式。维护模式被激活时，主机将无法接收新的客户虚拟机，并且已经在主机上运行的虚拟机被无缝地迁移到另一台不在维护模式下的主机上。迁移使用实时迁移技术和不中断客户的执行。"
