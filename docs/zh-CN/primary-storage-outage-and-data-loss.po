"When a primary storage outage occurs the hypervisor immediately stops all "
"VMs stored on that storage device. Guests that are marked for HA will be "
"restarted as soon as practical when the primary storage comes back on line. "
"With NFS, the hypervisor may allow the virtual machines to continue running "
"depending on the nature of the issue. For example, an NFS hang will cause "
"the guest VMs to be suspended until storage connectivity is restored.Primary"
" storage is not designed to be backed up. Individual volumes in primary "
"storage can be backed up using snapshots."
msgstr "当主存储发生故障，中断虚拟机管理程序立即停止该存储设备上存储的所有虚拟机。客户机被标记为，当主存储重新上线时，HA根据实际情况尽快将重新启动。使用NFS时，虚拟机管理程序可能允许虚拟机继续运行，这取决于问题的性质。例如，NFS挂起将导致客户虚拟机暂停，直至恢复存储连接。主存储没有被设计进行备份。在主存储中的单个卷，可以使用快照备份。"
