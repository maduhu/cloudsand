"When advanced networking is used, the administrator can create additional "
"networks for use by the guests. These networks can span the zone and be "
"available to all accounts, or they can be scoped to a single account, in "
"which case only the named account may create guests that attach to these "
"networks. The networks are defined by a VLAN ID, IP range, and gateway. The "
"administrator may provision thousands of these networks if desired."
msgstr "使用高级的网络时，管理员可以创建额外的网络供客人使用。这些网络可以跨越区域，并提供给所有帐户，或者他们可以到一个单一的帐户范围内，在这种情况下，只有指定的帐户可以创建连接到这些网络的宾客。网络被定义为一个VLAN ID，IP范围和网关。如果需要的话，系统管理员可能会提供成千上万的网络。"
