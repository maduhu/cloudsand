"Volumes are created for a specific hypervisor type. A volume that has been "
"attached to guest using one hypervisor type (e.g, XenServer) may not be "
"attached to a guest that is using another hypervisor type, for "
"example:vSphere, KVM. This is because the different hypervisors use "
"different disk image formats."

"&PRODUCT; defines a volume as a unit of storage available to a guest VM. "
"Volumes are either root disks or data disks. The root disk has \"/\" in the "
"file system and is usually the boot device. Data disks provide for "
"additional storage, for example: \"/opt\" or \"D:\". Every guest VM has a "
"root disk, and VMs can also optionally have a data disk. End users can mount"
" multiple data disks to guest VMs. Users choose data disks from the disk "
"offerings created by administrators. The user can create a template from a "
"volume as well; this is the standard procedure for private template "
"creation. Volumes are hypervisor-specific: a volume from one hypervisor type"
" may not be used on a guest of another hypervisor type."
