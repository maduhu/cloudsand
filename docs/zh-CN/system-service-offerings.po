"System service offerings provide a choice of CPU speed, number of CPUs, "
"tags, and RAM size, just as other service offerings do. But rather than "
"being used for virtual machine instances and exposed to users, system "
"service offerings are used to change the default properties of virtual "
"routers, console proxies, and other system VMs. System service offerings are"
" visible only to the &PRODUCT; root administrator. &PRODUCT; provides "
"default system service offerings. The &PRODUCT; root administrator can "
"create additional custom system service offerings."
msgstr "我们假设系统的服务提供了一个选择的CPU速度，CPU的数量，标签和RAM大小，就像其他的服务一样。但系统提供的服务，而不是用于虚拟机实例向用户公开，系统服务器用于更改虚拟路由器默熟悉，主机代理，和其他系统的虚拟机。系统服务器方案提供的服务是可见的&PRODUCT;root管理员。 &PRODUCT;提供了默认的系服务方案。 ，&PRODUCT;root管理员可以创建额外的自定义系统服务方案"

"When &PRODUCT; creates a virtual router for a guest network, it uses default"
" settings which are defined in the system service offering associated with "
"the network offering. You can upgrade the capabilities of the virtual router"
" by applying a new network offering that contains a different system service"
" offering. All virtual routers in that network will begin using the settings"
" from the new service offering."
