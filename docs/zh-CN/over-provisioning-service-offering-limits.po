"Service offering limits for gigahertz are enforced only in the presence of "
"contention for CPU resources. For example, suppose that a guest was created "
"with a service offering of 1 GHz on a Host that has 2 GHz cores, and that "
"guest is the only guest running on the Host. The guest will have the full 2 "
"GHz available to it. When multiple guests are attempting to use the CPU a "
"weighting factor is used to schedule CPU resources. The weight is based on "
"the clock speed in the service offering. Guests receive a CPU allocation "
"that is proportionate to the GHz in the service offering. For example, a "
"guest created from a 2 GHz service offering will receive twice the CPU "
"allocation as a guest created from a 1 GHz service offering. &PRODUCT; does "
"not perform memory over-provisioning."
msgstr "服务方案限制为千兆的，执行CPU资源争用机制。比如，假设一个来宾使用1GHz的服务提供方案，而它所在的主机有一个2GHz的核心，并且该来宾是此主机上唯一运行的实例。这个来宾将可以使用2GHz的cpu资源。当多个来宾打算使用CPU资源时，一个权衡机制将用来分配CPU资源。权重值基于来宾所使用的服务提供方案中指定的时钟频率。来宾被分配的CPU资源将服务提供方案中相应的频率执行。比如，一个使用2GHz服务提供方案的来宾将获得使用1GHz服务提供方案的来宾CPU资源的两倍，。&PRODUCT; 不支持内存超额分配。"
