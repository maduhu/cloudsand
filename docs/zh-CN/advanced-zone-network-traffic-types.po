"Guest. When end users run VMs, they generate guest traffic. The guest VMs "
"communicate with each other over a network that can be referred to as the "
"guest network. This network can be isolated or shared. In an isolated guest "
"network, the administrator needs to reserve VLAN ranges to provide isolation"
" for each &PRODUCT; account’s network (potentially a large number of VLANs)."
" In a shared guest network, all guest VMs share a single network."
