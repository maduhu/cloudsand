"The console viewing functionality uses a dynamic DNS service under the "
"domain name realhostip.com to assist in providing SSL security to console "
"sessions. The console proxy is assigned a public IP address. In order to "
"avoid browser warnings for mismatched SSL certificates, the URL for the new "
"console window is set to the form of https://aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd.realhostip.com."
" You will see this URL during console session creation. &PRODUCT; includes "
"the realhostip.com SSL certificate in the console proxy VM. Of course, "
"&PRODUCT; cannot know about the DNS A records for our customers' public IPs "
"prior to shipping the software. &PRODUCT; therefore runs a dynamic DNS "
"server that is authoritative for the realhostip.com domain. It maps the aaa-"
"bbb-ccc-ddd part of the DNS name to the IP address aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd on "
"lookups. This allows the browser to correctly connect to the console proxy's"
" public IP, where it then expects and receives a SSL certificate for "
"realhostip.com, and SSL is set up without browser warnings."
