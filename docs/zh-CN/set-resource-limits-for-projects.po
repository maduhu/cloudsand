"The &PRODUCT; administrator can set global default limits to control the "
"amount of resources that can be owned by each project in the cloud. This "
"serves to prevent uncontrolled usage of resources such as snapshots, IP "
"addresses, and virtual machine instances. Domain administrators can override"
" these resource limits for individual projects with their domains, as long "
"as the new limits are below the global defaults set by the &PRODUCT; root "
"administrator. The root administrator can also set lower resource limits for"
" any project in the cloud"
msgstr "&PRODUCT;管理员可以设置全局默认的限制，控制在云中的每个项目可以拥有的资源量。这是为了防止不受控制的资源使用，如快照，IP地址和虚拟机实例。域管理员可以取代他们域中个别项目的资源限制，只要新的限制是低于&PRODUCT;根管理员设置的默认全局限制。根管理员还可以为云中的任何项目设置较低的资源限制。"
