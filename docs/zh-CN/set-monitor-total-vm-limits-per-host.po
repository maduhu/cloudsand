"The &PRODUCT; administrator should monitor the total number of VM instances "
"in each cluster, and disable allocation to the cluster if the total is "
"approaching the maximum that the hypervisor can handle. Be sure to leave a "
"safety margin to allow for the possibility of one or more hosts failing, "
"which would increase the VM load on the other hosts as the VMs are "
"automatically redeployed. Consult the documentation for your chosen "
"hypervisor to find the maximum permitted number of VMs per host, then use "
"&PRODUCT; global configuration settings to set this as the default limit. "
"Monitor the VM activity in each cluster at all times. Keep the total number "
"of VMs below a safe level that allows for the occasional host failure. For "
"example, if there are N hosts in the cluster, and you want to allow for one "
"host in the cluster to be down at any given time, the total number of VM "
"instances you can permit in the cluster is at most (N-1) * (per-host-limit)."
" Once a cluster reaches this number of VMs, use the &PRODUCT; UI to disable "
"allocation of more VMs to the cluster."
msgstr "&PRODUCT;管理员应该监视每个集群中的虚拟机实例的总数，并禁止分配给集群接近最大的虚拟机管理程序可以处理。一定要留一个安全余量，允许一个或多个主机出现故障，这会增加其他主机上的虚拟机负载，增加自动重新部署的可能性。查询你选择虚拟机管理程序的文档，来发现的最大许可数量每台主机上的虚拟机，然后使用&PRODUCT;的全局配置设置设置为默认的限制。在每个群集在任何时候都监控虚拟机的活动。保持总的虚拟机数量低于安全水平，允许偶尔主机发生故障。例如，如果有N个集群中的主机，你想允许在集群中的一台主机是在任何给定的时间内，总数量的虚拟机实例，你可以允许集群中最多（N-1 ）*（每个主机的限制）。集群一旦达到这个数字的虚拟机，使用&PRODUCT; UI禁用分配更多的虚拟机的集群。"
