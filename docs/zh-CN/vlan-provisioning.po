"&PRODUCT; manages VLANs differently based on hypervisor type. For XenServer "
"or KVM, the VLANs are created on only the hosts where they will be used and "
"then they are destroyed when all guests that require them have been "

"For vSphere the VLANs are provisioned on all hosts in the cluster even if "
"there is no guest running on a particular Host that requires the VLAN. This "
"allows the administrator to perform live migration and other functions in "
"vCenter without having to create the VLAN on the destination Host. "
"Additionally, the VLANs are not removed from the Hosts when they are no "
"longer needed."

"You can use the same VLANs on different physical networks provided that each"
" physical network has its own underlying layer-2 infrastructure, such as "
"switches. For example, you can specify VLAN range 500 to 1000 while "
"deploying physical networks A and B in an Advanced zone setup. This "
"capability allows you to set up an additional layer-2 physical "
"infrastructure on a different physical NIC and use the same set of VLANs if "
"you run out of VLANs. Another advantage is that you can use the same set of "
"IPs for different customers, each one with their own routers and the guest "
"networks on different physical NICs."
