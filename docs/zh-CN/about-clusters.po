"A cluster provides a way to group hosts. To be precise, a cluster is a "
"XenServer server pool, a set of KVM servers, , or a VMware cluster "
"preconfigured in vCenter. The hosts in a cluster all have identical "
"hardware, run the same hypervisor, are on the same subnet, and access the "
"same shared primary storage. Virtual machine instances (VMs) can be live-"
"migrated from one host to another within the same cluster, without "
"interrupting service to the user."

"A cluster is the third-largest organizational unit within a &PRODUCT; "
"deployment. Clusters are contained within pods, and pods are contained "
"within zones. Size of the cluster is limited by the underlying hypervisor, "
"although the &PRODUCT; recommends less in most cases; see Best Practices."
