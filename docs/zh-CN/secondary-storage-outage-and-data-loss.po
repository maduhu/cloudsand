"For a Zone that has only one secondary storage server, a secondary storage "
"outage will have feature level impact to the system but will not impact "
"running guest VMs. It may become impossible to create a VM with the selected"
" template for a user. A user may also not be able to save snapshots or "
"examine/restore saved snapshots. These features will automatically be "
"available when the secondary storage comes back online."
msgstr "由于一个资源域只有一个二级存储服务器，二级存储的中断将会对系统的一些功能产生影响，但不能影响正在运行的客户虚拟机。可能会让用户无法选择模版来创建虚拟机。用户也可能无法保存快照，检查或恢复已保存的快照。当二级存储恢复连接后，这些功能也就可以自动恢复。"
