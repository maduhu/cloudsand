"There are two paths to restoring snapshots. Users can create a volume from "
"the snapshot. The volume can then be mounted to a VM and files recovered as "
"needed. Alternatively, a template may be created from the snapshot of a root"
" disk. The user can then boot a VM from this template to effect recovery of "
"the root disk."
msgstr "有两种方式恢复快照。用户能够从快照中创建一个卷。卷可以随后被装载到虚拟机上并且文件根据需要被复原。另一种方式是，模板可以从一个root 盘的快照创建。用户能够从这个模板启动虚拟机从而实际上复原root盘。"
