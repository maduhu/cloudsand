"&PRODUCT; administrators can specify that certain hosts should have a "
"preference for particular types of guest instances. For example, an "
"administrator could state that a host should have a preference to run "
"Windows guests. The default host allocator will attempt to place guests of "
"that OS type on such hosts first. If no such host is available, the "
"allocator will place the instance wherever there is sufficient physical "
"capacity."
msgstr "&PRODUCT;管理员能指定特定宿主机来有限运行莫特定类型的虚拟机实例。比如，管理员能指定某台宿主机优先运行windows的来宾虚拟机。默认的宿主机分配器会优先将该类型的来宾虚拟机分配到这类宿主机上。如果没有可用的这类宿主机，分配器将会把来宾虚拟机安排在任意满足该虚拟机硬件要求的宿主机上。"

"Both vertical and horizontal allocation is allowed. Vertical allocation "
"consumes all the resources of a given host before allocating any guests on a"
" second host. This reduces power consumption in the cloud. Horizontal "
"allocation places a guest on each host in a round-robin fashion. This may "
"yield better performance to the guests in some cases. &PRODUCT; also allows "
"an element of CPU over-provisioning as configured by the administrator. "
"Over-provisioning allows the administrator to commit more CPU cycles to the "
"allocated guests than are actually available from the hardware."
msgstr "垂直分配和水平分配均被支持。垂直分配将优先将虚拟机分配到一台宿主机上（直到不能分配为止）。这能降低电力消耗。水平分配以一种轮训的方式将虚拟机分配到各个宿主机上。这能在一些情况下带来更好的性。&PRODUCT;通过管理员的配置支持CPU超限分配，。超限分配允许管理员配置超过物理CPU能力若干倍的分配量。"

msgstr "&PRODUCT;也支持一种插件似的接口添加新的分配器。这些自定义的分配器能提供任意管理员七万个分配策略。"
