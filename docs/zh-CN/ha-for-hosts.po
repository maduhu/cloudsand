"The user can specify a virtual machine as HA-enabled. By default, all "
"virtual router VMs and Elastic Load Balancing VMs are automatically "
"configured as HA-enabled. When an HA-enabled VM crashes, &PRODUCT; detects "
"the crash and restarts the VM automatically within the same Availability "
"Zone. HA is never performed across different Availability Zones. &PRODUCT; "
"has a conservative policy towards restarting VMs and ensures that there will"
" never be two instances of the same VM running at the same time. The "
"Management Server attempts to start the VM on another Host in the same "
"cluster."
msgstr "用户可以给虚拟机制定开启高可用特性。默认情况下所有的虚拟路由虚拟机负载均衡虚拟机自动开启了高可用特性。当&PRODUCT;检测到开启了高可用特性的虚拟机崩溃时将会在相同的可用资源与中自动重新启动该虚拟机。高可用特性不会跨资源域执行。&PRODUCT; 采用比较保守的方式重启虚拟机，以确使不会同时运行两个相同的实例。管理服务器会尝试在本季群的另一台主机上开启该虚拟机。"
