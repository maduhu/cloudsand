"In the large-scale redundant setup described in the previous section, "
"storage traffic can overload the management network. A separate storage "
"network is optional for deployments. Storage protocols such as iSCSI are "
"sensitive to network delays. A separate storage network ensures guest "
"network traffic contention does not impact storage performance."
msgstr "在上一节中所描述的大型冗余设置中，存储流量管理网络过载。一个单独的存储网络的部署是可选的。如iSCSI存储协议是对网络延迟敏感的。一个单独的存储网络，确保宾客网络流量竞争不会影响存储性能。"
