"System service offerings provide a choice of CPU speed, number of CPUs, "
"tags, and RAM size, just as other service offerings do. But rather than "
"being used for virtual machine instances and exposed to users, system "
"service offerings are used to change the default properties of virtual "
"routers, console proxies, and other system VMs. System service offerings are"
" visible only to the &PRODUCT; root administrator. &PRODUCT; provides "
"default system service offerings. The &PRODUCT; root administrator can "
"create additional custom system service offerings."
msgstr "系統服務提供CPU速度、CPU數量、標籤及記憶體大小等選擇，如其他服務。但是除了給虛擬機器及使用者使用，此服務可以改變虛擬路由器、控制台代理及其他系統VM的預設性質。系統服務僅能被&PRODUCT; root 管理者使用，而&PRODUCT;會提供預設的系統服務。&PRODUCT; root管理者可以建立自訂的系統服務"

"When &PRODUCT; creates a virtual router for a guest network, it uses default"
" settings which are defined in the system service offering associated with "
"the network offering. You can upgrade the capabilities of the virtual router"
" by applying a new network offering that contains a different system service"
" offering. All virtual routers in that network will begin using the settings"
" from the new service offering."
msgstr "當 &PRODUCT; 建立虛擬路由器時，會使用預設設定。您可以藉由使用新的網路服務來更新虛擬路由器的能力，新的網路服務包含不同的系統服務。所有虛擬路由器會開始使用新的服務設定"
