"Additional user actions (e.g. setting a port forward) will cause further "
"programming of the firewall and load balancer. A user may request additional"
" public IP addresses and forward traffic received at these IPs to specific "
"VMs. This is accomplished by enabling static NAT for a public IP address, "
"assigning the IP to a VM, and specifying a set of protocols and port ranges "
"to open. When a static NAT rule is created, &PRODUCT; programs the zone's "
"external firewall with the following objects:"
msgstr "額外的使用者動作(例如設定port forward)會導致更多防火牆及load balancer的程式執行。使用者可能會要求額外的公開IP及IP的順向流量來指定VM，藉由啟用static NAT，指定IP到VM及指定一組協定及埠範圍開啟，我們可以達到這個要求，當static NAT rule建立時，&PRODUCT;會用以下物件來載入zone的外部防火牆："
