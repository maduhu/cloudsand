"&PRODUCT; administrators can specify that certain hosts should have a "
"preference for particular types of guest instances. For example, an "
"administrator could state that a host should have a preference to run "
"Windows guests. The default host allocator will attempt to place guests of "
"that OS type on such hosts first. If no such host is available, the "
"allocator will place the instance wherever there is sufficient physical "
"capacity."
msgstr "&PRODUCT; 管理者可以指定主機給特定的訪客類型。例如，管理者可以指定此主機優先執行Windows 訪客。預設主機分配者會依作業系統來分主機，如果沒有這種主機能用，分配者會在有足夠實體空間的地方放置 instance "

"Both vertical and horizontal allocation is allowed. Vertical allocation "
"consumes all the resources of a given host before allocating any guests on a"
" second host. This reduces power consumption in the cloud. Horizontal "
"allocation places a guest on each host in a round-robin fashion. This may "
"yield better performance to the guests in some cases. &PRODUCT; also allows "
"an element of CPU over-provisioning as configured by the administrator. "
"Over-provisioning allows the administrator to commit more CPU cycles to the "
"allocated guests than are actually available from the hardware."
msgstr "垂直與平行分配皆允許。垂直分配會在分配任一訪客到第二個主機前，消耗掉現在主機的所有資源，會減低電能消耗。水平分配會將訪客依round-robin的形式放在每個主機，這樣在某些例子可以有更好的效能。&PRODUCT;也允許CPU可以過度配置，由管理者設定。過度配置允許管理者有更多CPU cycles能分配訪客"
