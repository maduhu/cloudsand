"When you define a new virtual network, all your settings for that network "
"are stored in &PRODUCT;. The actual network resources are activated only "
"when the first virtual machine starts in the network. When all virtual "
"machines have left the virtual network, the network resources are garbage "
"collected so they can be allocated again. This helps to conserve network "
"resources."
