"Primary storage may be placed into maintenance mode. This is useful, for "
"example, to replace faulty RAM in a storage device. Maintenance mode for a "
"storage device will first stop any new guests from being provisioned on the "
"storage device. Then it will stop all guests that have any volume on that "
"storage device. When all such guests are stopped the storage device is in "
"maintenance mode and may be shut down. When the storage device is online "
"again you may cancel maintenance mode for the device. The &PRODUCT; will "
"bring the device back online and attempt to start all guests that were "
"running at the time of the entry into maintenance mode."
msgstr "主要儲存裝置有時會進入維護模式，比如說，替換故障的記憶體。維護模式會先停止新的使用者進入儲存裝置，然後會停止所有資料還存放在裝置上使用者。當所有使用者被停止，儲存裝置將進入維護模式或關機。當儲存裝置再度上線，您可以取消維護模式，&PRODUCT;會將裝置上線並嘗試讓之前被停止的使用者繼續使用。"
