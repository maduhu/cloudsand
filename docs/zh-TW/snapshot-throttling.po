"When a snapshot of a virtual machine is requested, the snapshot job runs on "
"the same host where the VM is running or, in the case of a stopped VM, the "
"host where it ran last. If many snapshots are requested for VMs on a single "
"host, this can lead to problems with too many snapshot jobs overwhelming the"
" resources of the host."
msgstr "當您要快取虛擬機器的圖案時，snapshot job會在和VM同一台主機上執行，或是最後執行的主機。如果在一台主機上有太多snapshots的工作，會導致這些工作佔用太多主機的資源"

"To address this situation, the cloud's root administrator can throttle how "
"many snapshot jobs are executed simultaneously on the hosts in the cloud by "
"using the global configuration setting "
"concurrent.snapshots.threshold.perhost. By using this setting, the "
"administrator can better ensure that snapshot jobs do not time out and "
"hypervisor hosts do not experience performance issues due to hosts being "
"overloaded with too many snapshot requests."
msgstr "雲端的root管理者可以調節有多少snapshot能夠同時執行，利用廣域設定來設定concurrent.snapshots.threshold.perhost。藉由此設定，管理者可以確定snapshot job不會超時，而超級監督者的主機不會有效能的問題"

"Set concurrent.snapshots.threshold.perhost to a value that represents a best"
" guess about how many snapshot jobs the hypervisor hosts can execute at one "
"time, given the current resources of the hosts and the number of VMs running"
" on the hosts. If a given host has more snapshot requests, the additional "
"requests are placed in a waiting queue. No new snapshot jobs will start "
"until the number of currently executing snapshot jobs falls below the "
"configured limit."
msgstr "設定concurrent.snapshots.threshold.perhost 為一個在已知現有資源及VM執行數量的情況下，所猜的最佳值，如果一個主機有很多snapshot要求，則新的要求會排到等待主列"
