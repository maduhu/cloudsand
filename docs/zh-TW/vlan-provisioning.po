"terminated or moved to another host."

"For vSphere the VLANs are provisioned on all hosts in the cluster even if "
"there is no guest running on a particular Host that requires the VLAN. This "
"allows the administrator to perform live migration and other functions in "
"vCenter without having to create the VLAN on the destination Host. "
"Additionally, the VLANs are not removed from the Hosts when they are no "
"longer needed."
msgstr "對於vSphere，VLAN會提共給所有叢集的主機，即使沒有任何訪客。此允許管理者執行實時移動及其他功能，不用再建立VLAN到目的地。除此之外，VLAN不會因主機不需要而被移除"

"You can use the same VLANs on different physical networks provided that each"
" physical network has its own underlying layer-2 infrastructure, such as "
"switches. For example, you can specify VLAN range 500 to 1000 while "
"deploying physical networks A and B in an Advanced zone setup. This "
"capability allows you to set up an additional layer-2 physical "
"infrastructure on a different physical NIC and use the same set of VLANs if "
"you run out of VLANs. Another advantage is that you can use the same set of "
"IPs for different customers, each one with their own routers and the guest "
"networks on different physical NICs."
msgstr "您可以在不同實體網路使用相同的VLAN，使實體網路可以有自己的層級-2基礎架構，像是交換器。例如，在進階區域設定部署實體網路A及B時，您可以指定VLAN範圍500到1000。此功能允許您建立一個額外的層級-2實體基礎架構在不同的實體NIC，並且可以使用相同的VLAN。其他優點像是不同客戶可以使用相同組的IP，但是在不同的實體NIC使用自己的路由器及訪客網路"
