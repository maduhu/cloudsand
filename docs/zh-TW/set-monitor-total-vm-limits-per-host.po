"The &PRODUCT; administrator should monitor the total number of VM instances "
"in each cluster, and disable allocation to the cluster if the total is "
"approaching the maximum that the hypervisor can handle. Be sure to leave a "
"safety margin to allow for the possibility of one or more hosts failing, "
"which would increase the VM load on the other hosts as the VMs are "
"automatically redeployed. Consult the documentation for your chosen "
"hypervisor to find the maximum permitted number of VMs per host, then use "
"&PRODUCT; global configuration settings to set this as the default limit. "
"Monitor the VM activity in each cluster at all times. Keep the total number "
"of VMs below a safe level that allows for the occasional host failure. For "
"example, if there are N hosts in the cluster, and you want to allow for one "
"host in the cluster to be down at any given time, the total number of VM "
"instances you can permit in the cluster is at most (N-1) * (per-host-limit)."
" Once a cluster reaches this number of VMs, use the &PRODUCT; UI to disable "
"allocation of more VMs to the cluster."
msgstr "&PRODUCT; 管理者需要監視每台叢集上有多少虛擬機器，如果接近超級監督者能負荷的最大量，管理者需要停止分配到此叢集。請確定遠離安全界線，以增加主機故障的容忍程度，主機故障會增加其他主機的虛擬機器負擔。參照您選擇的超級監督者文件，取得允許的最大量，然後使用 &PRODUCT;廣域組態設定將其設為預設值。隨時監視虛擬機器的活動，並保持虛擬機器總數在安全界線之下，以允許偶而的主機故障。例如，如果有N台主機，然後您想要隨時關閉一台主機，而能夠允許的虛擬機器總量最多為(N-1) *(每台主機限制)，一旦叢集達到限制數量，請使用 &PRODUCT;使用者介面來停止更多虛擬機器分配到此叢集"
