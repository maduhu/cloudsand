"Security groups provide a way to isolate traffic to VMs. A security group is"
" a group of VMs that filter their incoming and outgoing traffic according to"
" a set of rules, called ingress and egress rules. These rules filter network"
" traffic according to the IP address that is attempting to communicate with "
"the VM. Security groups are particularly useful in zones that use basic "
"networking, because there is a single guest network for all guest VMs. In "
"advanced zones, security groups are supported only on the KVM hypervisor."
msgstr "安全群組提供隔開VM及流量的方法。安全群組是根據規則過濾輸入輸出流量的一組VM，這些規則根據來源IP來過濾。安全群組在基本網路的區域中特別有用，因為僅有一個訪客網路對所有訪客VM。在進階區域中，安全群組僅支援KVM超級監督者"
