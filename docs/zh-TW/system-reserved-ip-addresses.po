"When advanced networking is being used, the number of private IP addresses "
"available in each pod varies depending on which hypervisor is running on the"
" nodes in that pod. Citrix XenServer and KVM use link-local addresses, which"
" in theory provide more than 65,000 private IP addresses within the address "
"block. As the pod grows over time, this should be more than enough for any "
"reasonable number of hosts as well as IP addresses for guest virtual "
"routers. VMWare ESXi, by contrast uses any administrator-specified "
"subnetting scheme, and the typical administrator provides only 255 IPs per "
"pod. Since these are shared by physical machines, the guest virtual router, "
"and other entities, it is possible to run out of private IPs when scaling up"
